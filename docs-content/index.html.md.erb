The Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF enables organisations to design, develop, deploy, manage and operate APIs, connectivity apps and microservices within the fully automated and transparent infrastructure provided by PCF. The different deployment scenarios that Runtime Manager supports are described in detail here: [Deployment Strategies](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies).


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition includes the following functionalities:

* [Runtime Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/), which lets you keep track of your deployed Mule applications
* [API Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/), which lets you keep track of your registered APIs
* [Anypoint Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange), where your organization can share various kinds of assets that can be reused throughout your integrations

Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF integrates PCF to the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition. It allows you to:

* Deploy Mule applications to PCF via the Runtime Manager UI as one more deployment target. See [Deployment Strategies](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies).
* Automatically create and deploy a Mule proxy application to PCF, which intercepts traffic to a non-Mule application, allowing you to apply policies over it and view usage metrics. See [Deploy a Proxy](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy)

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Each instance of the PCF Tile is linked to one PCF cluster, and every instance of the Space Configuration Tool is linked to one PCF space. Therefore, if you wish to manage multiple PCF spaces or multiple PCF clusters, you must also perform multiple installations of the Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF and the Space Configuration Tool to match these.
